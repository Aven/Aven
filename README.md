Good morning atrekkies üòôüòò
Currently working in my next text adventure script in C#
important update: Python was depreciated. Looked clean but proved difficult to detect faulty code.

Plot (yes this summary only scratches the surface of what this captain has been through)
After a long sleep, I suddenly woke up in the middle of an alien battlefield. Similarities to life on earth prequels but many things were far off.
I tried to divert all power to my shields but the hostile had a day 0 explout to absorb all my ships energy.
Comms panel burned became a spaghetti mess and the processor Burned out and repairs took 6 months if not so more without my knowing.
Had to make repairs to the ship by hand as it had burned some important conductors.
Found some keto ,- greatly appreciated thanks again guys üòâüòö
After getting the hard work done, took a rest. Still no sings of life or planets with humanlike or e lifestyle.
Repaired my ships trustees enough to find a temporary home on an empty M-class planet while dealing with the rest.
When thrusters got back online, I navigated that part of space as a pr0.be. Upped all my defenses against unknown intruders. Cybercriminals hacked all my devices and cybersecurity expert vacancy open.
I had two forcefield s layered, each on a diffent code and frequency. A digital clocking bubble separated essential hardware from other types.
I trusted no one. Only my own hand fake puppet which I haven't touched since Stardate 2200.0201 Loot. An orange cat that belongs to M.

-- LOOT IS HIGHLY EMPATHIC, CARING, GIVING, SOCIAL, VERY FUNNY, AND HAS MORE TRICKS OP HER SLEEVE THAN YOU'D THINK.
-- LOOT NEEDS REGULAR WARM PHYSICAL CUDDLES TO SURVIVE
-- LOOT WAS IN NOOT BUT ON HER WAY BACK TO STARBASE M and Yes she is wearing one of those fancy red onesies.
