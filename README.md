Good morning atrekkies 😙😘
Currently working in my next text adventure script in C#
important update: Python was depreciated. Looked clean but proved difficult to detect faulty code.

Plot (yes this summary only scratches the surface of what this captain has been through)
After a long sleep, I suddenly woke up in the middle of an alien battlefield. Similarities to life on earth prequels but many things were far off.
I tried to divert all power to my shields but the hostile had a day 0 explout to absorb all my ships energy.
Computer code became a spaghetti mess and the processor Burned out completely.
Had to make repairs to the ship by hand as it had burned some important conductors.
Found some stardust ,- greatly appreciated thanks again guys 😉😚
After getting the hard work done, took a rest. Still no sings of life or planets with AIR.
Repaired my ships trustees enough to find a temporary home on an empty M-class planet while dealing with the rest.
When warp drive got back online, I navigated that part of space as a pr0.be. Upped all my defenses against unknown intruders.
I had two forcefield s layered, each on a diffent code and frequency. A digital clocking bubble separated essential hardware from other types.
I trusted no one. Only my own hand puppet. Loot. An orange cat that belongs to ME.

-- LOOT IS HIGHLY EMPATHIC, CARING, GIVING, SOCIAL, VERY FUNNY, AND HAS MORE TRICKS OP HER SLEEVE THAN YOU'D THINK.
-- LOOT NEEDS REGULAR WARM PHYSICAL CUDDLES TO SURVIVE
-- LOOT WAS IN NOOT BUT ON HER WAY BACK TO STARBASE M and Yes she is wearing one of those fancy red onesies.

Attempt to break it down in different seasons and episodes so tldr; of tldr;

Season 0 - autopilot 
Captain's log system date 21000601 
Private space Battlefield Blvd Jacksonville Florida

Season 1 - a digital era 🧬 
Captain's log stardate 0022.0701
Finally discovered an M-class planet to survive after drifting alone in my spaceship for q,5 years

My mission?
Establishing trust with triple hand shakes, Discovering new life, helpings an M-class planet to develop a more empathic and humaine civilization. Where all can feel safe. To boldly go where no person has gone before. Warp speed 5-7 in one year of exploration.
